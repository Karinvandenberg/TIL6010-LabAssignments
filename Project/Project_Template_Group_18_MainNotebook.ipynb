    "## Introduction\n",
    "Nearly 60% of the Netherlands is flood prone [Ligtvoet, 2009]. 55% of this area includes the inland area that is protected by dunes and dikes [Minnen et al., 2012]. Regarding the floods, climate change influences the safety of the Netherlands in different ways. Besides the rise of the sea level, one of the most important factors that increase the risk of floods are the increasing peak discharges of rivers [Minnen et al., 2012]. For instance, in 2021, the extreme weather conditions and the substantial waterlevels of the rivers cause the second most expensive nature disaster of that particular year [nos, 2021]. In contrast to the high-waterlevels, climate change also causes drought. Due to the low waterlevels, freight transport via inland shipping has been difficult for some time. The waterlevel in the Rhine dropped to such an extent that shipping is hampered [Parool, 2022]. The ships can carry less so as not to lie too deep which causes more pressure on the freight transport via inland shipping. If climate change more often leads to extreme waterlevels and river discharges, the risk of these incidents will rise [Klijn et al., 2010]. According to [Baede, 2001], climate change refers to the average weather in terms of the mean and its variability over a certain timespan and a certain area [Baede, 2001]. The research objective of the project is therefore to investigate the extent to which climate change, in other words changes in temperature, affect Dutch waterlevels. Our hypothesis is that the changes in temperature play a major role in influencing the waterlevels in the Netherlands. The expectation is that the rise in average temperature is expected to increase the standard deviation of the waterlevel height.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Main research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extend does global temperature change influence Dutch river level heights?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the main question, some sub-questions have to be answered first. The following sub-questions are discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the river level heights in Lobith and Eijsden?\n",
    "2. What are the temperature changes in Europe between 1987 and 2022?\n",
    "3. To what extend does the standard deviation of the river level heights change per day, per month and per year?\n",
    "4. What is the pearson correlation coefficient between the standard deviation per year and month of the river level heights and the average temperature change per year?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data for the waterlevel heights used for this assignment was retrieved from Rijkswaterstaat. Data was available from 1980 (which was left out of further analysis) and 1987 until 2022, taken at the measuring points Eijsden and Lobith. These towns were selected because they lie on the Dutch border at the places where the Maas and the Rhine enter the Netherlands. The data gives the water level height compared to the NAP, not to the bottom of the river. This however will not be an issue, since only the variances and standard deviations will be used in this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the European temperatures, data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA) was used. From 1987 until August 2022, the monthly average temperature of Europe was selected. The dataset presents the anomaly (deviation from the standard) of the monthly temperature in °C, relative to the average of the base period 1910-2000.\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "For the visualization, an interactive plot will be made, showing the waterlevels and the average temperature, combined with a slider for the time. \n",
    "Also, a second plot will be made, plotting time against both waterlevel heights and temperature. This plot will also show the linear regressions of the temperature and the river level heights\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "In the hypothesis it was stated that the rise in average temperature is expected to increase the variance of the waterlevel height. The variance and the standard deviation of the waterlevel height differences are measured over the time spans of days, months and years. A Pearson’s r correlation test will be done on the temperature and the change of variance of waterlevel heights.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now time to answer the research question: To what extend does global temperature change influence Dutch river level heights?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the main question, some sub-questions have to be answered first. The following sub-questions are discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the river level heights in Lobith and Eijsden?\n",
    "As seen in the figures in the vizualisation section, the river level hights in Lobith vary between 700 and 1700 meters above NAP. The river level hights in Eijsden vary between 4400 and 5100 meters above NAP\n",
    "2. What are the temperature changes in Europe between 1987 and 2022?\n",
    "The anomalies of the temperature vary between -4 and 4 degrees with respect to the mean. Over time the anomalies are almost always above 0 degrees, so the temperature is going up. \n",
    "3. To what extend does the standard deviation of the river level heights change per day, per month and per year?\n",
    "The standard deviation of the river level heights per month and per year decreases as the time goes on. \n",
    "4. What is the pearson correlation coefficient between the standard deviation per year and monthe of the river level heights and the average temperature change per year?\n",
    "From the two figures above, the pearson correlation coefficient can be calculated:\n",
    "- The pearson correlation coefficient between the standard deviation per month of the river level heights in Lobith and the temperature anomalies is: -0.05250968513694182\n",
    "- The pearson correlation coefficient between the standard deviation per year of the river level heights in Lobith and the temperature anomalies is-0.1505277625352353\n",
    "- The pearson correlation coefficient between the standard deviation per month of the river level heights in Eijsden and the temperature anomalies is: 0.04826454945482567\n",
    "- The pearson correlation coefficient between the standard deviation per year of the river level heights in Eijsden and the temperature anomalies -0.3111443926833709\n",
    "A correlation coefficient under 0.4 whether negative or positive is said to be low [Obilor & Amadi, 2018]. This means that there seems to be little to no correlation between the changing temperature and the standard deviation of the river level hights in both Eijsden and Lobith. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to what extend does global temperature change influence Dutch river level heights? Our hypothesis stated that the changes in temperature play a major role in influencing the waterlevels in the Netherlands. The expectation is that the rise in average temperature is expected to increase the standard deviation of the waterlevel height. By analyzing our subquestions we can state that our results did not match with our hypothesis. Firstly we saw in subquestion 3 that the standard deviation of the river level heights decreased instead of increased. Secondly we expected the changes in temperature to influence the river levels in the Netherlands. Subquestion 4 showed that the Pearson correlation was alway between 0 and 0.4. This means there is little to no correlation between changes in temperature and river level heights instead of the expectation that changes in temperature play a major role in influencing the waterlevels in the Netherlands. So it seems that global temperature change barely influences the Dutch river level heights. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "follow-up research could look at measures that may have been implemented before that cause the lack of change in standard deviation of river level heights. It can also look at the effects of temperature change on river level heights in different countries. "
